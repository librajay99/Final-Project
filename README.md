# Final-Project
Topic : Home Management System

INTRODUCTION
 The Home Management System is the focus of this initiative.Home Management System is a simple way to manage and track various gadgets and appliances that we use on a daily basis in our homes. Holding lights, air conditioning, garage doors, surveillance cameras, motion monitors, Security management systems are all examples of these. 
 
 The aim of this project is to take wired appliances and attach them to a bluetooth module on an Android phone.On your Android smartphone, you must download an app; this app is no longer available on the Play Store, so I will attach a link to download it.
 This project calls for an HC-05 bluetooth module, but I didn't get one, so I used a BLE Grove Dual model, which you attach to your Android phone.
