# Final-Project
Topic : Home Management System

INTRODUCTION
 This project is on the Home management system. The point of this project is to use wired appliances and use it by a bluetooth module which is connected to a andriod phone. You have to download an app on your andriod device, this app is not available on the playstore anymore so I will be posting the link to download it.
 This Project uses a HC-05 bluetooth module but I didn't get that so I am using a BLE Grove Dual model and you connect this to your andriod phone.
